# Matplotlib-Challenge
In thie Project I was given the scenario of the following:
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

So then what I have done to tackle on this assignment is that I had to prepare the data in sections to properly evaluate and analysis the data.
I generated summary statistics and plotted them in a Bar and Pie Charts.
followed by calculating the quartiles, outliers and then placing these datas into a box plot to properly visualise the data.
I then created a line and a scatter plot to view the data from another point of view and based on that, calculated the correlation and regressioin of the datas inputted.
Only then when I finsihed preparing the data, I was able to make my analysis on the study.
